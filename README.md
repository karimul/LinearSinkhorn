# Linear Time Sinkhorn Divergences using Positive Features
Code of the paper by Meyer Scetbon and Marco Cuturi

## Approximation of the Regularized Optimal Transport in Linear Time


The implementation of the recursive Nystrom is adapted from the MATLAB implementation (https://github.com/cnmusco/recursive-nystrom)

## Generative Adversarial Network
The implementation of the WGAN is a code adapted from the MMD-GAN implementation (https://github.com/OctoberChang/MMD-GAN).



This repository contains a Python implementation of the algorithms presented in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.07057.pdf).
